# React with Idiomatic Redux

Based on the final product of a great Redux tutorial from Dan Abramov on Egghead.io.

Change/Updates:

Updated for React Router 4.1.1

Updated to latest versions of react-logger and normalizr.

## Installation

Initial code is based on create-react-app, so you can simply run:

```
yarn install
yarn start
```

All the other actions you can use create-react-app instructions of course.
